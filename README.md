# Closest match

This Streamlit app, titled "Closest Match Finder," allows users to find the closest match to a country name within a predefined list. Fuzzy matching using cosine similarity is employed for this purpose. Users can dynamically update the list by adding new countries through the sidebar.


Here's a brief explanation of the code:

1. **List of Items:**
   - `initial_items`: A predefined list containing country names such as "US," "UK," etc.

2. **Matching Function:**
   - `find_closest_match(query, items)`: A function that takes a user input (`query`) and a list of items (`items`). It converts both the query and items to lowercase, uses fuzzy matching with cosine similarity, and returns the closest match along with a confidence level.

3. **Streamlit App:**
   - `main()`: The main function for the Streamlit app.
   - The app has a title ("Closest Match Finder") and a text input for users to type a country name.
   - A sidebar allows users to manage items by adding new countries to the list.
   - The current list of items is displayed in the sidebar.
   - The app uses the `find_closest_match` function to find the closest match for the user input within the list of countries.
   - The result, including the closest match and confidence level, is displayed in the main content area of the app.

The code creates a simple and interactive interface for finding the closest match to a user-inputted country name based on fuzzy matching with cosine similarity.


Possible optimizations and improvements for the code:

1. **Efficiency with RapidFuzz:**
   - Replace `fuzzywuzzy` with `rapidfuzz` for improved efficiency in fuzzy matching algorithms.

2. **Threshold Adjustment:**
   - Experiment with and fine-tune the confidence threshold in the matching function to optimize the trade-off between precision and recall.

3. **Algorithm Selection:**
   - Explore other advanced matching algorithms, such as TF-IDF or Jaccard similarity, and assess their performance against cosine similarity.
